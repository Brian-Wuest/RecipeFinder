# RecipeFinder

A sample client/server application for Rust and Angular

## Database

The recipe finder database has a very simple recipe storage and is perfect for small example applications.
This is currently available as a MS SQL Server database but could easily be converted over to other open-source database types.

## Server

The backing server for this application is a Rust based web server.
There are plenty of comments and examples of how to set up a rust web server with routes, authorization, response codes, and response bodies.
Rust was chosen as the server language due to it's processing speed and memory safety guarentees.

## Client

The client application is an Angular front-end.
This was chosen due to familiarity with the Angular framework and community.
